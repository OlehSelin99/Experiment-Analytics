## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Node.js 16+
- npm or yarn

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/OlehSelin99/Experiment-Analytics.git
cd experiment-metrics
```

2. Install dependencies:

```bash
npm install
```

3. Start the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
```

4. Open your browser and navigate to `http://localhost:5173`

### Building for Production

```bash
npm run build
```

The built files will be in the `dist` directory.

## Usage

### CSV Format

Your CSV files should have these columns:

- `experiment_id`: The name or ID of your experiment
- `metric_name`: What you're measuring (like "loss" or "accuracy")
- `step`: Which training step this is
- `value`: The actual measurement

Here's an example:

```csv
experiment_id,metric_name,step,value
exp_1,loss,0,0.8995359313058078
exp_1,loss,1,0.8921633542579104
exp_1,accuracy,0,0.123456789
exp_1,accuracy,1,0.234567890
```

### How to Use

1. **Upload your data**: Drag and drop your CSV file or click to browse
2. **Pick experiments**: Choose which experiments you want to compare
3. **Select metrics**: Pick what you want to see (loss, accuracy, etc.)
4. **Analyze**: Look at the charts and compare your experiments
5. **Export**: Download your data if you need it

## What It Does

### File Upload

- Just drag and drop your files
- Checks if your CSV is formatted correctly
- Shows helpful error messages if something's wrong
- Works with big files too

### Experiment Selection

- Shows all your experiments
- Tells you how many metrics each experiment has
- You can select multiple experiments at once
- Clear visual feedback when you select things

### Charts

- Interactive line charts that look great
- Compare multiple experiments on the same chart
- Hover over points to see exact values
- Works on any screen size
- Each experiment gets its own color
- Smooth loading when data is processing
- Adjust data density for big datasets
- Toggle dots on/off for cleaner charts

### Data Processing

- Fast CSV parsing
- Automatically checks your data
- Only shows metrics that all your selected experiments have
- Handles missing data gracefully
- Smooth updates without lag
- Smart sampling for big datasets

### Key Components

- **Dashboard**: Main orchestrator component managing state and layout
- **FileUpload**: Handles CSV file upload with drag & drop
- **ExperimentSelector**: Manages experiment selection with bulk operations
- **MetricsChart**: Renders interactive line charts using Recharts
- **AnimatedBackground**: Provides animated particle background
